# linuxfundamentals
This is my first writeup from TryhackMe. It's really a simple set of notes to help me or others to brush up on the fundamentals of linux. There will be a linuxfundamentals 2 and 3 coming soon.

I have been working a lot of different style exploits and enumerations, will start documenting my journey there as well. It will slow down my studies but I that's okay. I will gain good and valuable experience in cybersecurity writeups.
